# My Neovim Config

My first attempt at putting together a config for neovim as a fully functional IDE
Initially followed a guide on youtube by ThePrimeagen and mixed in with some plugins in other popular out of the box nvim configs like NvChad and CosmicNvim.
Mostly just posting it here to have a nice backup option :)
