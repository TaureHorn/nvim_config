# ðŸ¤– Neovim Config ðŸ¤–
![nvim in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaureHorn/nvim_config/main/nvim_conf-screenshot.png)
My first attempt at putting together a config for neovim as a fully functional IDE.

Initially followed a guide on youtube by [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&t=151s&pp=ygUNdGhlcHJpbWVhZ2VuIA%3D%3D) and mixed in with some plugins in other popular out of the box nvim configs like NvChad and CosmicNvim.

Mostly just posting it here to have a nice backup option :)
